# Automatic Irrigation System

---

## Project Overview
The Automatic Irrigation System automates and monitors environmental conditions in a plant growth environment. It incorporates various sensors to measure soil moisture, temperature, and distance using an ultrasonic sensor. Actuators such as a water pump and a fan regulate these conditions. The system utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller and an LCD display for real-time data visualization.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno microcontroller
- Soil moisture sensor
- Temperature sensor (LM35)
- Ultrasonic distance sensor
- Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
- Water pump
- DC Fan

## Operation
- The system continuously monitors soil moisture, temperature, and proximity.
- Real-time data is displayed on the LCD screen.
- The water pump is activated when soil moisture falls below a certain threshold.
- The fan is activated when the temperature exceeds a specified limit.
- The LCD backlight turns off when an object is detected nearby by the ultrasonic sensor.
